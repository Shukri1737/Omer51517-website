         Muhammad Ali </a> </span> was born on <span class="redColor">January 17, 1942,</span> in Louisville, Kentucky.His birth name was Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.

At an early age, young Clay showed that he wasn’t afraid of any bout—inside or outside of the ring. Growing up in the segregated South, he experienced racial prejudice and discrimination firsthand.

At the <span class="redColor">age of 12,</span> Clay discovered his talent for boxing through an odd twist of fate. After his bike was stolen, Clay told police officer Joe Martin that he wanted to beat up the thief. “Well, you better learn how to fight before you start challenging people,” Martin reportedly told him at the time. In addition to being a police officer, Martin also trained young boxers at a local gym.

Clay started working with Martin to learn how to spar and soon began his boxing career. In his first amateur bout<span class="redColor"> in 1954,</span> he won the fight by split decision. Clay went on to win the<span class="redColor"> 1956 Golden Gloves tournament </span> for novices in the light heavyweight class. Three years later, he won the National Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions, as well as the Amateur Athletic Union’s national title for the light heavyweight division.

Clay attended mostly Black public schools, including Central High School <span class="redColor">in Louisville <a href="https://alicenter.org/boxing-timeline/">from 1956 to 1960</a>.</span> Clay often daydreamed in class and shadowboxed in the halls—he was training for the<span class="redColor"><a href="https://alicenter.org/boxing-timeline/"> 1960 </span> Olympics</a> at the time—and his grades were so bad that some of his teachers wanted to hold him back from graduation. However, the school’s principal Atwood Wilson could see Clay’s potential and opposed this, sarcastically asking the staff, “Do you think I’m going to be the principal of a school that Cassius Clay didn’t finish?”<span class="redColor">In 1960,</span> Clay won a spot on the U.S. Olympic boxing team and traveled to Rome to compete. At 6 feet, 3 inches tall, Clay was an imposing figure in the ring, but he also became known for his lightning speed and fancy footwork. After winning his first three bouts, Clay defeated Zbigniew Pietrzkowski of Poland <span class="blueColor">to win the light heavyweight Olympic gold medal.</span>

After his Olympic victory, Clay was heralded as an American hero. He soon turned professional with the backing of the Louisville Sponsoring Group and continued overwhelming all opponents in the ring.Clay met charismatic Nation of Islam minister Malcolm X at a rally in Detroit in<span class="redColor"> June 1962.</span>  Floored by Malcolm X’s fearlessness as an orator, the two developed a friendship and Clay became more involved in the Black Muslim group. Malcolm X even assigned an associate to help manage Clay’s day-to-day affairs.

<span class="redColor"><a href="https://alicenter.org/boxing-timeline/"></a>In 1964,</a> </span> Malcolm X brought his family to visit Clay while he trained in Florida for his <span class="redColor">February 25 title fight against Sonny Liston.</span> Clay’s victory over Liston earned him his first world heavyweight boxing championship. Following the win, the two held an evening of reflection in a hotel room with Jim Brown and Sam Cooke that became the inspiration for the One Night in Miami stage play and 2020 drama film.

The next morning, on <span class="redColor">February 26,</span> Clay announced his affiliation with the Nation of Islam. At first, he called himself Cassius X before settling on the name Muhammad Ali. Surprisingly, his allegiances were with supreme leader Elijah Muhammad and not the exiled Malcolm X. Ali and Malcolm’s friendship quickly fractured, and the two went their separate ways by that spring.
